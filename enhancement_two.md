# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
The artifact I have chosen for Algorithms and Data Structures came from code written in 
python for CS-350 Emerging System Architectures and Technologies in February 2021. The original
purpose of this project code was to utilize a RaspberryPi with a GrovePi board connected via the
GPIO connector while utilizing various sensors to collect temperature, humidity, and light data. 
Additionally, the data collected was stored into a JSON file to be read by an HTML dashboard. I
have chosen to enhance this artifact by adding an LCD screen to the GrovePi board. In realtime I am
going to display the temperature and humidity data on the LCD screen. 

This artifact was chosen as it demonstrates my abilities in Python and my understanding of using 
best practices for developing in Python. I wanted to be able to control an LCD screen so that I 
could build my own weather station. To do this required the use of a handler to control and 
manipulate the LCD screen. This artifact will showcase my understanding and abilities in developing
handlers in a python class based data structure while following industry standards and and best
practices. nSpecifically, I used proper method naming by using a single `_` prefix for non-public
methods while reserving the non prefixed methods as public methods. I used sufficiently small method
implementations in which each method performed a specific function and together would operate the
LCD screen appropriately.

The process of enhancing the program from a data structure and algorithms perspective was 
educational for me. One of the challenges I faced was the lack of documentation for the LCD
operations. The required methods and functionality was poorly documented. The documentation of the 
LCD screen did provide some example uses and through teh limited information I was able to collect I
was able to successfully implement an LCD handler class.

Overall, the artifact for data structures and algorithms was adding additional functionality and
complexity to the program by implementing an LCD handler so that temperature and humidity 
could be displayed on the LCD screen. I am implementing proper documentation by commenting the 
code appropriately for all of the functions as well as providing a handler description at the
beginning of the class objects and variables.
