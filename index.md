## Professional Reflection

### How We Got Here
My journey in the Computer Science program started in August of 2018. I chose to come back to 
college after having a long and decent career as a Systems Engineer. I wanted to step out and 
expand my knowledge and position myself for additional career growth or career shifting. There were 
also job opportunities that I was rejected from due to my lack of a degree. I felt the time was 
right this time. My current career I deal with automation and devops. I already use many of the 
skills that were taught throughout my degree path such as coding practices, security standards, 
client server development etc.

My career plans are to shift into more of a software engineering role to learn this side of the 
industry. I have the Systems Engineering experience and knowledge for the past 15 years and now I
am wanting to peek behind the curtain of the software engineering stage. This direction will
hopefully make me a well-rounded individual contributor with a vast body of knowledge and
experience that will better position me for a leadership role.

### Education Reflection
As I worked through the various courses of the Computer Science program I was able to strengthen my 
existing knowledge and experience as well as learn completely new areas. that really stands out
for me is IT-315 Object Oriented Analysis and Design. In this class I was learning about designing 
a software product based on requirements, building use cases, documenting classes, building 
functional and behavioral models. It was overall very difficult but also very rewarding to learn 
and succeed in this course. This was an interesting course, and I had a great professor, Dr. 
Manning, teaching this course. He was in fact one of the best instructors I have had at
this school.

Additionally, in CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms I was learning about the different data 
structures. I have used many of these data structures in my own programming career, but I never
knew how they were implemented and built. This course took me down the path of learning to build these 
data structures. In fact, I had a project at work in which I was able to build my own linked list 
map that I would have never known if not for this class.

When it came to collaboration and team projects, CS-310, I was already far ahead of the class in
this. I use version control repositories such as GIT every day. I am a top contributor in my
company for reviewing various Merge Requests and providing appropriate feedback. What this class did
achieve for me is working with a team of peers that had limited or no knowledge of these tools or
concepts. I became a tutor in many ways in helping students learn and understand these
concepts.

These are just a few courses that really stand out for me but my educational journey at SNHU has
provided many classes that have allowed me to expand on my current knowledge or experience new
and exciting areas of study. I really enjoyed the mathematics courses and I am hoping to do
additional self-study in this realm to really help solidify the knowledge.
