## Professional Reflection

### How We Got Here
My journey in the Computer Science program started in August of 2018. I chose to come back to 
college after having a long and decent career as a Systems Engineer. I wanted to step out and 
expand my knowledge and position myself for additional career growth or career shifting. There were 
also job opportunities that I was rejected from due to my lack of a degree. I felt the time was 
right this time. My current career I deal with automation and devops. I already use many of the 
skills that were taught throughout my degree path such as coding practices, security standards, 
client server development etc.

My career plans are to shift into more of a software engineering role to learn this side of the 
industry. I have the Systems Engineering experience and knowledge for the past 15 years and now I
am wanting to peek behind the curtain of the software engineering stage. This direction will
hopefully make me a well-rounded individual contributor with a vast body of knowledge and
experience that will better position me for a leadership role.

### Education Reflection
As I worked through the various courses of the Computer Science program I was able to strengthen my 
existing knowledge and experience as well as learn completely new areas. that really stands out
for me is IT-315 Object Oriented Analysis and Design. In this class I was learning about designing 
a software product based on requirements, building use cases, documenting classes, building 
functional and behavioral models. It was overall very difficult but also very rewarding to learn 
and succeed in this course. This was an interesting course, and I had a great professor, Dr. 
Manning, teaching this course. He was in fact one of the best instructors I have had at
this school.

Additionally, in CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms I was learning about the different data 
structures. I have used many of these data structures in my own programming career, but I never
knew how they were implemented and built. This course took me down the path of learning to build these 
data structures. In fact, I had a project at work in which I was able to build my own linked list 
map that I would have never known if not for this class.

When it came to collaboration and team projects, CS-310, I was already far ahead of the class in
this. I use version control repositories such as GIT every day. I am a top contributor in my
company for reviewing various Merge Requests and providing appropriate feedback. What this class did
achieve for me is working with a team of peers that had limited or no knowledge of these tools or
concepts. I became a tutor in many ways in helping students learn and understand these
concepts.

These are just a few courses that really stand out for me but my educational journey at SNHU has
provided many classes that have allowed me to expand on my current knowledge or experience new
and exciting areas of study. I really enjoyed the mathematics courses and I am hoping to do
additional self-study in this realm to really help solidify the knowledge.

### Portfolio Summary
In my portfolio I have brought together three artifacts: Software Engineering and Design, Data
Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. My portfolio is a reflection of a single code project
that I chose to enhance to display my learning progression as well as my specific skills I bringw
with these enhancements. The goal was to build a weather station using a RaspberryPi and a
GrovePi board with multiple sensors connected to provide the data readings. Using industry best
practices, standards, and security considerations I was able to provide these enhancements and
this portfolio is a reflection of this journey.

The artifact I have chosen for Software Engineering and Design category came from code written in 
python for CS-350 Emerging System Architectures and Technologies in February 2021. In this code we 
were to collect some sensor data and store this data into a JSON file. The program runs at specified 
intervals to collect the data. My enhancement for this is to increase the complexity and to collect 
real-time data while also outputting the data to an LCD screen. I will be using a multiprocessor 
approach to offload the data writing process to its own process while the sensor collecting will 
continue to run in its own process. This is a best practice approach as data writes are typically 
a slower process and if collecting real-time data this will need to be offloaded for performance 
reasons.
This enhancement will demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, 
and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver 
value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

The artifact I have chosen for Software Engineering and Design category came from code written in 
python for CS-350 Emerging System Architectures and Technologies in February 2021. In this code we 
were to collect some sensor data and store this data into a JSON file. The program runs at 
specified intervals to collect the data. As part of my enhancements I am including an LCD screen 
and will be outputting the temperature and humidity data to the
LCD screen. To accomplish this I need to create a new LCD handler datastructure to control the 
functionality of the LCD scree, including controlling the RGB coloring of the background as well
as the text output. This enhancement will accomplish the outcome of design and evaluate computing 
solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices
and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

The artifact I have chosen for Databases category is coming from code written in python for CS-350 
Emerging System Architectures and Technologies in February 2021. In this code we were to collect 
some sensor data and store this data into a JSON file. However, the correct solution should be to 
store this data into a database. The enhancement I will be providing here will be to use a Time 
Series database such as InfluxDB. This can also be achieved with a NoSQL database such as MongoDB. I 
am choosing to use an InfluxDB database as it is a time series database specifically designed for 
real-time metric collection. The flow chart of Category one is the same for this category.
This enhancement will accomplish the outcomes of demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and 
innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing 
computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
